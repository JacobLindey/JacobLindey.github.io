Hi I'm Jacob Lindey.

I'm a software developer living in Grove City, Pennsylvania and work as the Junior Software Engineer at [Pine Instrument Company]().

## Contact

If you have any questions about any of my blogged material I'd be happy to chat about .NET, software architecture, or UX design. Feel free to [send me an email]().

## Why I'm here

The goal of this blog is to share my experiences working in a position where I have my fingers in so many pies. From one day to the next, my role can vary wildly -- converting a 20-year-old legacy enterprise management system on Monday, maintaining the company website on Wednesday, and working on an embedded system by Friday.

I'm not really sure what the scope of the content here will be but it will act as a dumping ground for ideas I come across in the future. Think of it as a currated collection of other people's ideas, my own ramblings, and solutions to problems that I don't want to forget.

Other young developers may find this blog useful as a resource. There's a lot you don't get taught in school and -- having been thrown in the fires of legacy code hell -- I might have a few tips to offer. If you have any suggestions for things I can improve on, please reach out.

## Current Projects

In addition to my work at Pine I'm juggling a few side projects:

1. is continuing to blog about my struggles and successes as a developer.
2. is the beginnings of a book about converting legacy systems to modern technologies.
3. is a venture into amateur game design that may see the light of day in the future.

## Boring stuff about me

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania. I mainly focused in theoretical math, which (strangely) I use almost every day.

## Fun stuff about me

### Gaming

I'm an avid gamer, whether on the table or behind the keyboard. Trading cards, roleplaying adventures, and puzzles are my favorite but I'll give anything a try. Like many, dreams of game design was my first avenue into software.

### Movies

I have a love of the movies -- the chill of a theatre, mediocre popcorn and coke, the collective experience of an audience member. My friends would call my taste... strange. My favorites are those that leave you asking, "What did I just watch?" Here are some recommendations:

- [2001: A Space Oddessy]() 
- [The Lighthouse]()
- [A Clockwork Orange]()
- [They're Made Out of Meat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tScAyNaRdQ)
