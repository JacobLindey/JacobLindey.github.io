I"Ì<p>Hi Iâ€™m Jacob Lindey.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a software developer living in Grove City, Pennsylvania and work as the Junior Software Engineer at <a href="">Pine Instrument Company</a>.</p>

<h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>

<p>If you have any questions about any of my blogged material Iâ€™d be happy to chat about .NET, software architecture, or UX design. Feel free to <a href="">send me an email</a>.</p>

<h2 id="why-im-here">Why Iâ€™m here</h2>

<p>The goal of this blog is to share my experiences working in a position where I have my fingers in so many pies. From one day to the next, my role can vary wildly â€“ converting a 20-year-old legacy enterprise management system on Monday, maintaining the company website on Wednesday, and working on an embedded system by Friday.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not really sure what the scope of the content here will be but it will act as a dumping ground for ideas I come across in the future. Think of it as a currated collection of other peopleâ€™s ideas, my own ramblings, and solutions to problems that I donâ€™t want to forget.</p>

<p>Other young developers may find this blog useful as a resource. Thereâ€™s a lot you donâ€™t get taught in school and â€“ having been thrown in the fires of legacy code hell â€“ I might have a few tips to offer. If you have any suggestions for things I can improve on, please reach out.</p>

<h2 id="current-projects">Current Projects</h2>

<p>In addition to my work at Pine Iâ€™m juggling a few side projects:</p>

<ol>
  <li>is continuing to blog about my struggles and successes as a developer.</li>
  <li>is the beginnings of a book about converting legacy systems to modern technologies.</li>
  <li>is a venture into amateur game design that may see the light of day in the future.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="boring-stuff-about-me">Boring stuff about me</h2>

<p>I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics from Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania. I mainly focused in theoretical math, which (strangely) I use almost every day.</p>

<h3 id="gaming">Gaming</h3>

<p>Iâ€™m an avid gamer, whether on the table or behind the keyboard. Trading cards, roleplaying adventures, and puzzles are my favorite but Iâ€™ll give anything a try. Like many, dreams of game design was my first avenue into software.</p>

<h3 id="movies">Movies</h3>

<p>I have a love of the movies â€“ the chill of a theatre, mediocre popcorn and coke, the collective experience of an audience member. My friends would call my tasteâ€¦ strange. My favorites are those that leave you asking, â€œWhat did I just watch?â€ Here are some recommendations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="">2001: A Space Oddessy</a></li>
  <li><a href="">The Lighthouse</a></li>
  <li><a href="">A Clockwork Orange</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tScAyNaRdQ">Theyâ€™re Made Out of Meat</a></li>
</ul>
