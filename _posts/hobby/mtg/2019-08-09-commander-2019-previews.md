It's Commander 2019 preview season and of course I'm interested.

<!-- end-excerpt -->

We've seen the lists of all four decks: Faceless Menace, Mystic Intellect, Primal Genius, and Merciless Rage.
Each deck is centered around a different mechanic from throughout Magic's history: Morph, Flashback, Populate, and Madness respectively.

I've been wanting to build a morph/manifest for years so it's a pretty easy decision for me what deck I'll pick up on the 23rd, but I also wanted to go over my favorite cards from the set.
New cards and reprints are both the focus of these products and it shouldn't always be about the cash.

## Faceless Menace -- Morph

### Kadena, Slinking Sorcerer


<img src="https://img.scryfall.com/cards/large/front/6/8/68a144f1-df18-4dc5-81c3-dff2af27527f.jpg?1565003086" alt="Kaden, Slinking Sorcerer" class="mtg-card-center-50">

Ahh, Kadena my queen!
This is not your ordinary Naga Wizard.
No, sir!
This is a warpin' morphin' machine.

_"The first face-down creature spell you cast each turn costs {3} less to cast."_

This right here is incredibly important for making morphs work.
The only other deck I've seen use morphs effectively in EDH is Animar and that's mainly due to his cost reduction mechanics.

Kadena may only reduce the first morph, but that's far more than most cards can boast.
Also notice "each turn".
So important.
Give your morphs flash with [Leyline of Anticipation](https://scryfall.com/card/m20/64/leyline-of-anticipation) or [Vivien, Champion of the Wilds](https://scryfall.com/card/war/180/vivien-champion-of-the-wilds).
It's not the easiest thing to pull off, but it gets you one free more on **each** turn.

_"Whenever a face-down creature enters the battlefield under your control, draw a card."_

A great commander needs card advantage printed somewhere in its text box.
[Thrasios](https://scryfall.com/card/c16/46/thrasios-triton-hero), [Tymna](https://scryfall.com/card/c16/48/tymna-the-weaver), [Kraum](https://scryfall.com/card/c16/34/kraum-ludevics-opus), [Gitrog](https://scryfall.com/card/soi/245/the-gitrog-monster) and many, many more top tier commanders draw cards.

I'm not saying that Kadena is top tier, far from it.
Morphs just aren't _that_ viable.
But she gives some strength to an otherwise weak archetype.

It's also important to note that this works with Manifest.
Great stuff.

### Kadena's Silencer

<img src="https://img.scryfall.com/cards/large/front/c/f/cfe101fc-0c3d-461b-8c46-bb1bef97e739.jpg?1565003119" alt="Kadena's Silencer" class="mtg-card-center-50">

As with Kadena, her signature spell, or in this case signature spy, is clutch.

**Imagine this:** Your opponent has spent the last few turns building up their favorite Planeswalker's loyalty in hopes of ulting it only to have a Naga Wizard swoop in and silence it's final hurrah.
Classic.

### Sudden Substitution

<img src="https://img.scryfall.com/cards/large/front/9/f/9f7983bf-2a3b-4428-8c01-35285f589da8.jpg?1565157260" alt="Sudden Substitution" class="mtg-card-center-50">

"I'll take that [Expropriate](https://scryfall.com/card/cn2/30/expropriate), thanks.
Oh, and you can have this
*slides manifested land across table*."

Need I say more.

### Thieving Amalgam

<img src="https://img.scryfall.com/cards/large/front/0/6/06ed7c94-ed3c-427a-b62a-32e91e054671.jpg?1565126435" alt="Thieving Amalgam" class="mtg-card-center-50">

_Snape. Snape. Severus Snape._

But seriously, cool design.
Unique ability.
Manifesting other people's decks onto your field?
Is this new?
Pretty sure it is.

A little concerned that this 7-drop doesn't quite cut it.
I usually want some kind of guarantee of value from such a big investment and this probably wouldn't -- definitely shouldn't -- last a round on the table.

### Reprints

Some reprints I like seeing come out this deck include:
[Seedborn Muse](https://scryfall.com/card/bbd/212/seedborn-muse),
[Ixidron](https://scryfall.com/card/c14/116/ixidron),
[Strionic Resonator](https://scryfall.com/card/a25/232/strionic-resonator),
[Vraska the Unseen](https://scryfall.com/card/ddm/42/vraska-the-unseen),
[Ghastly Conscription](https://scryfall.com/card/c16/111/ghastly-conscription), and
[Tempt with Discovery](https://scryfall.com/card/c16/170/tempt-with-discovery).


## Mystic Intellect -- Flashback

### Elsha of the Infinite

<img src="https://img.scryfall.com/cards/large/front/3/b/3b977c0b-07a1-4d16-9fdd-fc0563e0b68e.jpg?1565166765" alt="Elsha of the Infinite" class="mtg-card-center-50">

_Wait?
That's not the face commander._

Yep.
Sadly, [The Chronoclasm](https://scryfall.com/card/c19/49/sevinne-the-chronoclasm) just didn't spark my interest.
But this I can get behind.

I think it's a more acceptable [Narset](https://scryfall.com/card/ktk/190/narset-enlightened-master), one that I don't feel needs to be removed on sight.
That said, I think it has some competitive potential.

The card functions similarly to [Melek](https://scryfall.com/card/c15/227/melek-izzet-paragon) but doesn't play in the same way.
You can cast any noncreature, nonland card, not just instants and sorceries.
Much more viable.

Also gives flash which opens up control builds a bit more.

Seems like an interesting build.
I play [Raff](https://scryfall.com/card/dom/202/raff-capashen-ships-mage) right now and this has me thinking that maybe this is a switch I could make.

### Empowered Autogenerator

<img src="https://img.scryfall.com/cards/large/front/2/c/2c9b8d53-97c9-4e3d-a8c6-6abd78db6390.jpg?1565086189" alt="Empowered Autogenerator" class="mtg-card-center-50">

Why?
Just why?

They printed a manarock that's worth a removal spell.

Sure it takes a while to get started but that can be broken pretty easily.
As they card itself says: _Magic, unlike physics, has no unbreakable laws._

Use [Pir](https://scryfall.com/card/bbd/11/pir-imaginative-rascal) or [Doubling Season](https://scryfall.com/card/bbd/195/doubling-season) to get additional counters.
Maybe [Seedborn Muse](https://scryfall.com/card/bbd/212/seedborn-muse) or [Unwinding Clock](https://scryfall.com/card/c18/228/unwinding-clock) to get extra counters on other players turns.
Seems pretty nasty.

### Dockside Extortionist

<img src="https://img.scryfall.com/cards/large/front/5/7/571bc9eb-8d13-4008-86b5-2e348a326d58.jpg?1565176092" alt="Dockside Extortionist" class="mtg-card-center-50">

When I see a card with such flavor baked into its name, type, both mechanical and flavor text, I can't help but smile.

Oh, and it's pretty powerful too.

### Reprints
Some reprints I like seeing come out this deck include:
[River Kelpie](https://scryfall.com/card/shm/49/river-kelpie),
[Clever Impersonator](https://scryfall.com/card/ktk/34/clever-impersonator), and
[Ghostly Prison](https://scryfall.com/card/pca/7/ghostly-prison).

## Primal Genius -- Populate

### Atla Palani, Nest Tender

<img src="https://img.scryfall.com/cards/large/front/f/6/f6aa473b-85cd-431d-844b-218368fe955e.jpg?1565175000" alt="Atla Palani, Nest Tender" class="mtg-card-center-50">

While I think [Ghired](https://scryfall.com/card/c19/42/ghired-conclave-exile) is the stronger general out of the box, Atla is more interesting to me.
She's like a new [Mayael](https://scryfall.com/card/c13/199/mayael-the-anima) and she's a bit of a meme with her eggs.

I've wanted to try a [Polymorph](https://scryfall.com/card/m10/67/polymorph) deck for some time and this seems like an interesting way of going about it.
And without blue to boot!

My build would feature a few high impact creatures.
I'm thinking [Avacyn, Angel of Hope](https://scryfall.com/card/ima/11/avacyn-angel-of-hope) and [Archetype of Endurance](https://scryfall.com/card/bng/116/archetype-of-endurance) to protect the board, [Vorinclex](https://scryfall.com/card/ima/189/vorinclex-voice-of-hunger), [Void Winnower](https://scryfall.com/card/bfz/17/void-winnower), and [Angelic Arbiter](https://scryfall.com/card/cma/4/angelic-arbiter) to bind up our opponents.

Then you're free to either build up a combo (maybe with other creatures) or go with a more brutish end-game.
Even [The Second Sun](https://scryfall.com/card/akh/4/approach-of-the-second-sun) is an option.

### Soul of the Worldsoul

<img src="https://img.scryfall.com/cards/large/front/b/b/bb73ec0d-f582-4f74-9b5c-180fe3aedcf6.jpg?1565195907" alt="Soul of the Worldsoul" class="mtg-card-center-50">

I was expecting this exact card when I heard that populate was a keyword for these decks.
We have one for proliferate so why not?

Not sure this is incredibly strong.
It's a do-nothing enchantment for 6 CMC so you'll need support.

Combo potential of course.

### Ohran Frostfang

<img src="https://img.scryfall.com/cards/large/front/9/e/9eb08e11-c247-404c-9f40-a12cb7087d0c.jpg?1565176697" alt="Ohran Frostfang" class="mtg-card-center-50">

A strong finisher for green.
Makes all your creatures into [Ohran Vipers](https://scryfall.com/card/c15/194/ohran-viper).
Not bad.

### Reprints
New art on some
[Lightning Greaves](https://scryfall.com/card/c19/217/lightning-greaves) and
[Mimic Vat](https://scryfall.com/card/c19/219/mimic-vat).
[Trostani](https://scryfall.com/card/c19/204/trostani-selesnyas-voice) with guild kit art is a cool include too.


## Merciless Rage -- Madness

### Chainer, Nightmare Adept

<img src="https://img.scryfall.com/cards/large/front/d/7/d7b0a8f8-d368-45e6-a546-984e7b1913e0.jpg?1565260796" alt="Chainer, Nightmare Adept" class="mtg-card-center-50">

Again, not the face commander.
The deck just doesn't support it.

I've been looking at the original [Chainer](https://scryfall.com/card/tor/56/chainer-dementia-master) for EDH but this just seem better.
Two colors, discard theme, hasty, delicious.

### Bone Miser

<img src="https://img.scryfall.com/cards/large/front/a/7/a7fa6901-e74f-448c-9d26-99a692092512.jpg?1565291677" alt="Bone Miser" class="mtg-card-center-50">

Reverse [Waste Not](https://scryfall.com/card/c16/117/waste-not) that works well in a reanimator theme or madness if you try to make that work.
Not exactly what I would call "creative design" but it's definitely useful.

### Aeon Engine

<img src="https://img.scryfall.com/cards/large/front/e/a/ea4dfdd7-f35a-45d6-9fc7-2c096f92dd5f.jpg?1565265971" alt="Aeon Engine" class="mtg-card-center-50">

They forgot to give this a silver border, right?

I'm not too far out there thinking this can be broken in a number of different ways.
Like I said earlier, I play [Raff](https://scryfall.com/card/dom/202/raff-capashen-ships-mage) and he makes [Nevinyrral's Disk](https://scryfall.com/card/c17/217/nevinyrrals-disk) a little busted on the untap.
This doesn't wipe the board but it does essentially say "target player skips their next turn."

Also best flavor text in the set.

_Paradox? Eh, we'll worry about that yesterday._

### Reprints
New art on a much needed reprint [Solemn Simulacrum](https://scryfall.com/card/c19/222/solemn-simulacrum).
[Chaos Warp](https://scryfall.com/card/c18/122/chaos-warp) started getting up near $5 so that's nice.
[Geth](https://scryfall.com/card/som/64/geth-lord-of-the-vault) was nice to see.
Nothing too crazy here.


## Conclusions

Overall, this year's commander offerings are ripe for the picking.
I've seen plenty that I like, plenty of mediocre reprints, and plenty of janky includes, but that's what Commander Precons are.

I was a little surprised to hear that we're not getting a green Magus card to finish out the cycle yet.
Sounds like we should look to Throne of Eldraine for that.

I've heard a lot of people bringing up Signets as a needed reprint but they were just in the guild kits.
Magic products are confirmed 8 months ahead of release so they couldn't have known that the guild kits wouldn't be enough.

My favorite deck is, of course, Faceless Menace -- which should have been called Faceless Invasion by the way -- but I recognize it's probably not the strongest.

I'll rate the decks in terms of playable power out of the box, usefulness of new cards, reprint equity, and how closely they relate to the theme they're supposed to represent.

| Deck             | Power | New Cards | Reprints | Theme | Overall |
|------------------|:-----:|:---------:|:--------:|:-----:|:-------:|
| Faceless Menace  |  2nd  |    1st    |   1st    |  1st  |   1st   |
| Mystic Intellect |  3rd  |    2nd    |   4th    |  3rd  |   3rd   |
| Primal Genius    |  1st  |    4th    |   2nd    |  2nd  |   2nd   |
| Merciless Rage   |  4th  |    3rd    |   3rd    |  4th  |   4th   |

Of course this is just my opinion so take it with a grain of salt.

That's it for Commander (2019 Edition) from me.

-- Be seeing you.
