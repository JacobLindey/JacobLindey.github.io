This tutorial series is designed for undergraduate math students wishing to learn the fundamentals of programming with python.

<!-- end-excerpt -->

While I was at Slippery Rock University I noticed that many math students lacked core programming skills.
Many of them had written a few scripts here or there, used software like Mathematica, or taken an introductory course on programming C++, but none of them had any real understanding or experience with object-oriented approaches.

This is completely understandable.
Not all of us have time in our degrees to include this useful subject matter.

This is where _Python for the Math Major_ comes in.


## Why Python?

While it wasn't my first language, Python quickly took hold as my preferred space for handling data and automation tasks, two things many math students find themselves working around every day.
So I set out learning as much about the language as I could.
Whether through tutorials or brute force documentation, I've managed to gather quite an understanding of the language over the last four years.
And now I want to share it with you.


### Why should I learn from you?

That's a valid question.
I'm just a regular math nerd who happened to learn to code but there is one trait this blog has that most online tutorials don't -- I'm went through exactly what you are right now.
Being an undergraduate math major is no simple task but you gain a lot of tools from it.
Most coding tutorials focus on rote memorization or build concepts from the ground up -- concepts that mathematicians like us have already learned, just in a different way.

I by no means claim that this method is unique, or even good.
At best, it limits my audience to those who have learned at least the basic concepts of discrete mathematics, Pre-Calculus, Differential Calculus, and Linear Algebra.
At worst, this idea is simply bad and will fall on its face midway through development.
Either way, it'll be a journey.


### Origins

Most of the material of this tutorial series was developed over my time as a student, although it wasn't exactly written down.
It's more of a method of thought that I maintained while working through a computer science minor and taking CS electives.
A framework for learning, if you will.

I shared this method with a few of my non-CS friends that wanted to learn how to code. It seemed to help them so I thought I'd share it here.


## Approach

The best coding tutorials avoid using external libraries and functionality in favor of promoting the fundamentals.
As such, the first few units of this series will be devoid of references to powerful packages such as _matplotlib_ or _pandas_.
We'll move onto some popular packages after we've learned the basics so that you can more easily put your new skill to use.

### Prerequisites

My goal here is to make this series as approachable as possible.
As such, no real knowledge of programming or Python is required.

Even lacking knowledge of certain math concepts shouldn't put you too far behind as I intend to explain them as we go -- both as a refresher for us math-folk and as an overview for everyone else.

That said, this series is aimed at math majors in their second or third year. Keep that in mind as we move forward.


## Setting Things Up

I'm not here to teach you how to install software.
There are plenty of good tutorials out there that can more effectively explain this than I can.

Below I'll go through what you'll need to get setup and some recommendations on software and tutorials should you need them.


### Installing Python

Before we get started, you're going to need to install Python. I'm afraid that there are just too many things that could go wrong here and there are plenty of good tutorials on installing Python.

Make sure to get the newest stable version of Python 3.

[Here's the official installation guide.](#)


### The Python Interpreter

In the early days of this tutorial, we'll be sticking to the Python Interpreter in the command prompt for Windows or terminal for Linux.
Understanding how to open a terminal is all you'll need.

### Choosing an Editor

At some point along our journey we'll move from the interpreter to writing standalone scripts. To do this we'll need to edit and save Python documents.

Lucky enough for us, Python can be edited in plain text which gives a lot of options to choose from.
And I mean a lot, folks.

Personally, I use [Atom](#).
It's made by the developers of GitHub and it's simple, cross-platform, and easily customizable.
Get it if you're not sure where to turn.

For other options, something as simple as Notepad will work, just make sure to steer clear of Microsoft Word and Google Docs.
Those aren't the same and they definitely won't work.

Here are some other options:
- [NotePad++](#)
- [Pycharm](#)
- [Spyder](#)

All of these are good options; just pick one and stick with it.


## What's Next?

We've gone over what this series is all about, what you should expect, and what you need to have to get started.
Next time we'll dive right into the code.

--- Be seeing you.
