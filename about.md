<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

_A software developer based in the greater Pittsburgh area._

I recently graduated from Slippery Rock University and I'm ambitiously looking for a position in a company that would allow me to make something bigger than myself.
I believe that software has the ability to change the world -- we've definitely seen this over the last 30 years -- and I want to be a part of it.

Python is my language of choice, but I have experience in Java, C/C++, and C# as well.
I've both written code from scratch and developed packages that interface with preexisting software, worked alone and in groups on projects in and outside the classroom, and developed software for use by, and to the specifications of, a layperson.
