# My Projects

From time to time I'll have a project that I think is worth sharing with people, so I host them on GitHub. Some of them are just passion projects, others I did while I was a student.


## Math Projects

Here are some extra-curricular projects that I did while I was a student. Since I studied math, they tend to rely on some theoretical mathematics at times.


### Manifold Classifier

_A bipyramidal, 3-manifold classifier built with Python for Regina 5.1._

This project was developed over the course of a year long research project. It classifies a described 3-Manifold, a type of mathematical structure, using a fixed set of parameters. This is achieved by interfacing with Regina, a low-dimensional topology analysis software package. The code here is rather simple but the math behind it is quite complex.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold) has a good overview of 3-Manifolds if you're interested.


### Language Distribution Predictor

_A forecasting model for predicting the distribution of spoken language._

During my junior year I participated in [MCM 2018](https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/), a four day math modeling competition centered around real world problems and solutions. Originally I worked on this project with two partners, but I took to re-structuring, -writing, and -documenting it in an updated version that is available at the link below.

The goal of the project was to produce a _"proof of concept"_ model that could predict how many people would speak each of 13 popular languages across the world in 50 years time. While we lacked the data to produce accurate results, it is reasonable that our solution would  the job done.

As part of the competition, we had to submit a [PDF](/assets/downloadables/mcm2018-final-paper.pdf) document explaining the project's mechanics and providing a _"corporate"_ explanation of the results.
_**Disclaimer:** This isn't my best writing and a substantial part of it was written by partners, but it is a good explanation of the project._
